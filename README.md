# Green Space Audit

Green Space Audit is an application designed to help users learn about the green spaces around them. Users can explore green spaces on the map, check in to green spaces they visit, comment and rate spaces they check in to, and add new green spaces. Think yelp, but for fields and parks. Users are also rewarded for visiting green spaces and for contributing to the community by adding a space or commenting on one. If a user is an administrator, then they can also view data analytics for the green spaces.

Note: the code in this repository was migrated from a previous repository following a major refactoring of the project. The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/dgupta18/green-space-audit
